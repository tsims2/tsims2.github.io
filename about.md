    <div class="about-content">
      <p>With a Master’s in Applied Data Science and 12 months of full-stack energy data automation (2–3 million rows/month per database), I specialize in:</p>
      <ul class="skills-list">
        <li>Building Python pipelines & Azure SQL systems for ISO-NE, PJM, ERCOT, CAISO, MISO</li>
        <li>Developing Power BI dashboards adopted by analysts, sales teams, and engineers</li>
        <li>Forecasting load with neural-net models and crafting real-time CO₂ emissions indices</li>
        <li>Integrating CI/CD (GitHub Actions), containerization (Docker), and MLOps best practices</li>
        <li>Collaborating cross-functionally to replace legacy processes with lean, scalable tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When I'm not automating data flows, you'll find me tinkering with new forecasting architectures, exploring Jupyter-centric MLOps, or walking my dogs around NYC.</p>
