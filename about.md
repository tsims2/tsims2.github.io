Hi, I’m **Tyler Sims**—an Operations Analyst at CPower Energy on a mission to step into Data Science leadership.

With a Master’s in Public Policy (Columbia) and 12 months of full-stack energy data automation (2 – 3 million rows/month per database), I:

- 🚀 Build Python pipelines & Azure SQL systems for ISO-NE, PJM, ERCOT, CAISO, MISO  
- 📊 Develop Power BI dashboards adopted by analysts, sales teams, and engineers  
- 🔮 Forecast load with neural-net models and craft real-time CO₂ emissions indices  
- ☁️ Integrate CI/CD (GitHub Actions), containerization (Docker), and MLOps best practices  
- 🤝 Collaborate cross-functionally to replace legacy processes with lean, scalable tools  

When I’m not automating data flows, you’ll find me tinkering with new forecasting architectures, exploring Jupyter-centric MLOps, or walking my dogs around NYC.  

Feel free to browse my Projects page or drop me a line!
