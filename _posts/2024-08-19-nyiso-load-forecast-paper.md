Accurate real-time load forecasts are critical for grid stability and market efficiency. In this paper I:

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Aggregated 5 years of NYISO load and weather data into 15-minute intervals  
   - Engineered calendar features: weekday/weekend flags, holidays, and time-of-day indicators  

2. **Model Architecture**  
   - Developed a feed-forward ANN with two hidden layers (64 & 32 units)  
   - Employed dropout and L2 regularization to mitigate overfitting  
   - Trained with early stopping on validation MAPE  

3. **Results**  
   - Achieved a test MAPE of **2.3%**, outperforming an ARIMA baseline (3.1%)  
   - Reduced peak-hour errors by 15%â€”improving dispatch margin recommendations  

4. **Next Steps**  
   - Integrate anomaly detection for outage events  
   - Explore transformer-based time-series models
