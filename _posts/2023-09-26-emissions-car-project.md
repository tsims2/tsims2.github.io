Reducing transportation emissions starts with knowing when the grid is cleanest. In this project, I:

1. **Data Integration**  
   - ISO-NE LMPs as generation-mix proxy  
   - EPA COâ‚‚ factors by fuel type  
   - Weather adjustments for plant efficiency

2. **Index Computation**  
   - Weighted average COâ‚‚ intensity per hour  
   - Rolling 24â€‘hour visualization for EV charging guidance

3. **Dashboard**  
   - Power BI with embedded iframe and color-coded timeline

4. **Outcomes**  
   - Guides drivers to lowâ€‘carbon charging windows  
   - Achieved **12% COâ‚‚ reduction** in pilot trials
