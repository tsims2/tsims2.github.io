Reducing transportation emissions starts with knowing when the grid is cleanest. The **Emissions Car** project delivers:

1. **Data Integration**  
   - Hourly ISO-NE Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) as a proxy for generation mix  
   - Emission factors by fuel type (COâ‚‚ kg/MWh) from EPA databases  
   - Weather adjustments for fossil-plant efficiency variations  

2. **Index Computation**  
   - Weighted average COâ‚‚ intensity per hour  
   - Rolling 24-hour visualization for EV charging guidance  

3. **Interactive Dashboard**  
   - Built in Power BI and embedded via iframe  
   - Color-coded timeline: green (low emissions) to red (high emissions)  

4. **Outcomes**  
   - Provides drivers and fleet managers with actionable charging windows  
   - Demonstrated 12% average COâ‚‚ reduction in pilot fleet charging trials
