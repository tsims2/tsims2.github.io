## 🔮 Energy Load Forecasting  
**ANN-Based Hourly Predictions for NYISO**  
I designed and trained an artificial neural network to predict real-time hourly loads across New York ISO. The model ingests historical consumption, weather variables, and calendar effects—delivering 1–3% MAPE improvements over baseline statistical methods.

## 🌱 CO₂ Emissions Car  
**Real-Time Grid Emissions Index & Vehicle Charging Insights**  
“Emissions Car” computes an index of ISO-NE grid CO₂ intensity—combining hourly LMPs, fuel-type emissions factors, and weather data—to inform low-carbon charging strategies for electric vehicles.
